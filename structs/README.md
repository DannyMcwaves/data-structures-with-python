# data structures

A way to store and organize data so that it can be used effectively
within a computer.

We can talk about data structures as:
1. mathematical/logical models - ADT.
2. concrete implementations.

## ADT's
abstract data types have data and operations on that set data but no concrete
implementations.

NB: the study of data structures is not just about the the data and operations on that data nor is
it about the implementations of that structure.
**IT IS ALSO ABOUT ANALYZING THE COST OF THESE OPERATIONS/IMPLEMENTATIONS IN TERMS OF TIME/SPACE(MEMORY)**
